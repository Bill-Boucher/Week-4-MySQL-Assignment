# Week-4-MySQL-Assignment
Week 4 MySQL assignment I had to create 5 stored procedures for MySQl.
The first stored procedure -- Allows to find employees names with certain title.
The second stored procedure -- Finds if an employee makes a salary over 60k.
The third stored procedure -- Allows to see rank of average salaries.
The fourth stored procedure -- Shows how many employees have a specific job title.
